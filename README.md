## About me
Hi, I like programming!\
I learned Java and python as a self-taught, using the first to create various videogames (see [my itch.io profile](https://g3dev.itch.io/)) and a 2D game engine called [G3GE](https://github.com/G3Dev-0/G3GE_2D).\
I use python almost on a daily basis to create little scripts that automate simple but repetitive tasks (see for example the [Markdown-TOC-generator](https://github.com/G3Dev-0/Markdown-TOC-Generator) or the [Fun with Python series](https://github.com/G3Dev-0/FunWithPython)).\
Using python I am also maintaining [PyLab](https://github.com/G3Dev-0/pylab) a library that can be used to rapidly analyze and plot data from school and university laboratory experiments.\

I have always been fascinated by the exciting world of OpenGL and rendering engines, and lately I have been delving into this world while also learning the C programming language.\
To put these knowledge into practice I am working on [G3CE](https://github.com/G3Dev-0/G3CE) a projet I would like to turn into a user friendly rendering/game/simulation engine.

You can contribute to any of my projects of course... just open a pull request, collaboration can make programming even funnier!

## My best projects:
+ **[G3CE](https://github.com/G3Dev-0/G3CE):** a C and OpenGL based rendering/game/simulation engine (still working on it)
+ **[PyLab](https://github.com/G3Dev-0/pylab):** a scientific data analysis and plotting library made with python, matplotlib, numpy and scipy
+ **[Sprout](https://github.com/G3Dev-0/Sprout):** a user friendly program made with python and tkinter, that uses the dot language to create family trees based on the people data provided by the user
+ **[G3GE](https://github.com/G3Dev-0/G3GE_2D):** a Java 2D game engine I used to make some of my games in the past five years (see, for example, [The Island on itch.io](https://g3dev.itch.io/the-island))

## My tech stack
### Programming Languages
+ **Java (7 years experience):** using abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation to make simple videogames and G3GE, a 2D game engine I made using pure Java
+ **python (4 years experience):** used for automating tasks and to create a data analysis and plotting library ([PyLab](https://github.com/G3Dev-0/pylab))
+ **C (almost a year):** used for scientific calculations and for creating [G3CE](https://github.com/G3Dev-0/G3CE)

### Libraries I have worked with
+ **LWJGL (a couple months):** used to make a proof of concept doom-styled game you can find [here](https://g3dev.itch.io/3d-opengl-game)
+ **LibGDX (2 years):** used to create a videogame about making sandwiches (you can [play it on your browser](https://g3dev.itch.io/sandwich-restaurant-simulator))
+ **OpenGL:** I know the basics and I am still learning it

### Other tools
+ **LaTeX** (1 year experience)
+ **Markdown** (2 years experience)
